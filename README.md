The motivation for and intention of this repository is to create companion texts to common undergraduate mathematics courses; it is intended to supplement the more-or-less rote method of teaching of mathematics with explanations to the hypothetical student as to why these topics ate being studied, what their historical significance is, how they will be reused later in the student's mathematical education, and what ties to other fields of mathematics should be appreciated along the way. In brief, this is a reaction to the unfortunately rote method in which mathematics is usually taught. It is an open source efforts whose aim is to significantly supplement mathematical education around the world.
